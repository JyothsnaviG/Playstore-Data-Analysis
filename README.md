# Playstore-Data-Analysis

## About the project:
In this project, you will be working on a real-world dataset of the google playstore, one of the most used applications for downloading android apps. This project aims on cleaning the dataset, analyze the given dataset, and mining informational quality insights. This project also involves visualizing the data to better and easily understand trends and different categories.


### Input Files:
playstore_apps.csv - It contains the basic details of the app like number of user reviews, ratings, etc.

playstore_reviews.csv - It contains the user reviews and its sentiment score for the respective app.


## Project Description:
This project will help you understand how a real-world database is analyzed using SQL, how to get maximum available insights from the dataset,pre-process the data using python for a better upcoming performance, how a structured query language helps us retrieve useful information from the database, and visualize the data with the power bi tool.
The Project will consist of 2 modules:


### Module 1: Pre-processing, Analyzing data using Python and SQL.
In this module, you will query the dataset using structured query language to gain insights from the database. The problem statements to be solved will be provided to you and you need to provide the solution for the same using your logic. Different concepts of SQL will be used in this process such as aggregating the data, grouping the data, ordering
the data, etc.


### Module 2: Visualizing data using Power bi.
In this module, you will be using both datasets for visualizing what the numbers in and behind the data want to convey. You have to create a dashboard for the same using different statistical graphs and diagrams for a visual understanding and analysis.
